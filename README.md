# simple_keylogger
Made years ago as practice when I began learning C.

Two different versions using different methods, found at hook/ and async/.     
Hook/main.c uses hooks to obtain the key messages while async/main.c makes use of the GetAsyncKeyState() function.

extras.c contains some extra functionatilies that could be added to the keylogger, such as downloading and uploading files and a half-done reverse shell.


It's an abandoned pet project, basically.
